Mittens for Detroit, Inc., is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that collects, purchases,and distributes
new mittens and gloves to children, teens, and adults in need in Detroit, Michigan, and other underserved cities.The company was founded in 2010 and has donated over 325,000 pairs of mittens to local schools, veterans orginizations, homeless shelters, etc. It is ran by one woman who has kept track of all her volunteers and their hours worked in a binder on sheets of paper. After volunteering at the orginization our group saw an oppurtunity to make an impact on our community and help Mittens for Detroit track their volunteer data electronically. Our team designed and built an application that will automatically log every volunteer and keep track of all their hours worked, orginization they worked with, as well as whether or not they want to be part of the Mittens for Detroit newsletter. Our app will be able to free up time for Mittens for Detroit to be able to send out more clothing to the people who need it and show donors how many people are interested in volunteering their time to make in impact on their community.
